## Python Calculator with simple GUI
This Calculator comes as easy as it comes. It includes easy calculation methods and is inspired by the built in Windows Calculator. This was my first time working with the PyQt6 Library. There are still some little GUI errors. 
I made this in a single evening. However I am going to continue improving this Calculator. </br> </br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8856a35-3feb-49a5-865e-61c784e0c463)
